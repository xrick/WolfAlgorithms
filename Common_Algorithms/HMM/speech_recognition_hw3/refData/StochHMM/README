#StochHMM - A Flexible hidden Markov model application and C++ library.

StochHMM is an easy to use and flexible hidden Markov model (HMM)
application and C++ library. It implements HMMs from a simple
user-defined text file. Thereby, allowing researchers to focus on the
design and optimization of the model rather than spending precious time
implementing HMM algorithms.

StochHMM implements standard HMM, HMM with duration and in the future
will implement hidden semi-Markov model architectures and algorithms. It
grants researchers the power to integrate additional datasets in their
HMM to improve predictions. Finally, it adapts HMM algorithms to provide
stochastic decoding giving researchers the ability to explore and rank
sub-optimal predictions.

We are providing StochHMM source which can be compiled and used a a 
standalone application and/or static C++ library to give researchers the
ability to rapidly develop HMMs.

StochHMM and compiles on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. We are providing
StochHMM under the MIT open source license to increase accessibility and
to give researchers the ability to use it in derivative works without
restrictions.  See COPYING
